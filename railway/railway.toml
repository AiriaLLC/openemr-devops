# Railway deployment configuration for OpenEMR

# Use the Dockerfile in this directory
dockerfilePath = "railway/Dockerfile"

[deploy]
# OpenEMR needs significant time to initialize on first start
# - Database schema creation
# - Initial data population
# - File permission setup
# This can take 5-10 minutes on first boot

# Number of replicas (keep at 1 for database consistency)
numReplicas = 1

# Restart policy
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 5

# Note: Health checks are intentionally not configured here
# OpenEMR's long startup time can cause premature health check failures
# After initial setup, you can enable health checks via Railway dashboard:
#   Path: /
#   Timeout: 300 seconds

# Railway deployment configuration for OpenEMR
# https://docs.railway.app/reference/config-as-code

[build]
# Use the Dockerfile in this directory
dockerfilePath = "railway/Dockerfile"

[deploy]
# OpenEMR needs significant time to initialize on first start
# - Database schema creation
# - Initial data population
# - File permission setup
# This can take 5-10 minutes on first boot

# Number of replicas (keep at 1 for database consistency)
# Note: For better performance, consider increasing to 2-3 replicas
# if your Railway plan supports it and you have proper session handling
numReplicas = 1

# Restart policy
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 5

# Note: Health checks are intentionally not configured here
# OpenEMR's long startup time can cause premature health check failures
# After initial setup, you can enable health checks via Railway dashboard:
#   Path: /
#   Timeout: 300 seconds

# IMPORTANT: CPU and Memory limits must be set via Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
# 2. Select the service (openemr or MySQL)
# 3. Go to Settings > Resource Limits
# 4. Adjust vCPU and RAM sliders
# 
# Recommended minimums for production:
# - OpenEMR: 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM
# - MySQL: 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM
# 
# For better performance with demo data:
# - OpenEMR: 4 vCPU, 4GB RAM
# - MySQL: 4 vCPU, 4GB RAM
